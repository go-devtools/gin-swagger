# gin-swagger

[简体中文](README.zh-cn.md)

Non-invasive Gin source contract generation and runtime integration for native OpenAPI 3.2.

This repository is under active implementation. The full acceptance target is recorded in [GOAL.md](GOAL.md); current evidence and remaining work are tracked in [status](docs/status.md) and [verification](docs/verification.md). It is not yet a completed or released product.

## Requirements

- Exactly Go 1.27.1 for minimum-version acceptance.
- Gin v1.12.0 for minimum-version acceptance.
- The final module must consume a real fixed remote version of `github.com/openapi-golang/openapi`.

## Architecture

Go source and real codec behavior define structure; ordinary comments provide business meaning. Documentation generation must not change business DTO tags, handler bodies, signatures, or existing route registration.

The core owns type projection, comments, neutral effects, Bundle and OpenAPI models. Framework adapters own framework call semantics, route syntax, handler evidence and mounting. Runtime document construction never imports the compiler or reads application source.

## Capability boundaries

- **Automatically derived:** types, supported wire representations and recognized source effects, as verified by implementation tests.
- **Explicitly declared:** semantic constraints and advanced contracts; these are not proof that the server enforces them.
- **Centrally adapted:** custom codecs and unsupported project helpers through explicit Go extension points.
- **Unresolved:** ambiguous or unsupported behavior must produce a diagnostic rather than a guessed response.

Future Fiber and Echo adapters are extension directions only. They are not products delivered or claimed as supported by this repository.
